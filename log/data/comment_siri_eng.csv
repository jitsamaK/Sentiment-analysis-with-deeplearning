If it is inconvenient to come in during office hours Maintain the symptoms for many years. Viruses, hepatitis values are reduced. But with cirrhosis Because living before treatment, do not take care of yourself, underestimate the risk. Keep the ultrasound to see the liver meat. Until February 1973, it was found that there was a lump in the liver that made MRI. The doctor diagnosed with cancer. I used to ask the doctor if I had cancer. Did I die? The doctor can tell if he can know quickly. The doctor who takes care of the liver sends me to see a surgeon by hiring a doctor to diagnose the surgery. And explain how to treat me thoroughly By forwarding it to Dr. Radiation to do the first step Is to give chemo to the lump To inhibit the growth of it The radiological view of my MRI is interested in the lump. Because it doesn&#39;t look like cancer cells So ask to cut that lump. Rules that yes But not cancer caused by liver meat But is a bile duct cancer in the liver Subsequent work, radiologist Appointed me to fill the vein in the right liver with a lump.
