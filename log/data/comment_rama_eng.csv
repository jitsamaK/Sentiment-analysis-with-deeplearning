Waiting for a long time But have to call to reserve in advance The love of the doctor&#39;s education hurts me. Less than 5 minutes treatment The result came out, the leaves on the face disappeared. Love fee is not expensive as well."
1,"I used to go to LASIK here. Very good. Now, it has been 2 years since it has no outstanding results and the price is also good. The cut may look scary. But when it was really time to do it, it didn&#39;t hurt. Because there was a drop of anesthetic before dissection"
2,"Maintained for many years since the age of 14 Will now have a bachelor&#39;s degree From sleeping in the midst of the arthropod until he recovered, he could live a normal life. In particular, premium clinics do not have to wait for a long time. There are convenient, fast, every step from paying to dispensing.

3,"At the 2nd floor of Phra Thep building, the place looks modern. But at the pressure measuring room There are people at the temple (thinking that it&#39;s not a nurse because wearing a purple dress) likes to scold people who come to the temple. Speak stiffly to people who come to measure pressure. In spite of the other nurses who put on a nursing gown, said because Want to improve Come to the doctor at the surgery department Dr. Tawut, then told to have surgery. Just saying that he had to surgery to be healed at that time, he was shocked about the surgery. And the fog went, not really telling what was the distance (Roi-Laem) and then meeting The nurse at Nuek Kyu doesn&#39;t care when we repeat what he says is correct. Just saying that In conclusion, it seems to be good, but waiting to see the surgery before"
4,"Its a public hospital so service is bad (nurses are completely unfriendly and doctors have god complex plus horrifying bed side manner) but they will keep you alive (nothing to do with quality of life) with decent drug collection. Young doctors are generally very friendly but they are busy all the time due to the amount of patients (like canned tuna) so don't expect them to spend too much time diagnosing you. You have to come early in the morning to ensure you're in queue and the wait 1-2 (bad days) hours behind schedule to get to see the doctor for < 15 min or less (all together door to door 8-9hrs).  Additionally you can call all the 8 numbers on the websites from normal clinic to Premium and wait 15 minutes on each number just for them to hang up on you or divert you elsewhere then hang up on you..... Worst are the guys doing the schedule because they are very consistent in demonstrating the inability to manage schedules (or not) because you will ""always"" have to wait 1-2 hours ""after"" your appointment schedule to see the doctor but they also cant tell you that so you cant go anywhere and have to hang around the front door.  In the better days you will get to sit inside the doctor's room to wait because the doctor is no where to be found and nobody will know when he/she will come back. If you ask the nurse they will give you the ""i dont know and I couldnt care less"" look and turn away in annoyance.  But yes, they have great ability (the doctors definitely know what they are doing) to use ur tax fund to keep you alive, two stars for that!! Updated review for ER: The best ER u can probably find in Bangkok as they are 24hrs fully staffed with specialty doctors (not just general doctors like other hospitals during off business hours). They are jammed packed but they are fully equipped and by that I mean they have CT scanner in the ER room - this is not something we find everywhere. Doctors know what they are doing and fully equipped with the tools to keep u alive. Even better update: Just decided to go for full blown annual health check at Rama (Feb 2016) and here are the pros and cons: Cons:As a foreigner who pays tax in Thailand ur sort of half screwed. They are not equipped to handle foreign language so if u cant google medical terms properly u might go home thinking everything is perfect when its not...A less life threatening case is that if u pay tax to Thailand ur entitled to Thai citizen price 30% less or so which is surprisingly logical BUT not without flaws...u have to bring the ""physical"" ""original"" tax receipt from revenue dept to show then which u DONT get if u file electronically....so....who does NOT file electronically? I dont know one....maybe my parents but they're 75.... Pros:Omg its a very pleasant surprise that this clinic operates with the speed, manner, and professionalism that you'd expect in that of top 5 high end private hospital. The ambiance, the friendliness, politeness (which usually does not happen in public hospital), and the facility is great. I am very impressed with the speed at which they operate so thats 8.30-12:00 easy. Just like u would get at private hospital. 4th floor Prathep bldg zone Q - they did an exceptional job of scanning our x ray and ultrasound result 2-3 times just to make sure its accurate and they call u of the pending result (in case there is a need for special radiologist to check the films) in less than 4 hours after doctor visit. Overall - hell yeah I will do my Health check here going forward for 1/3 the price i would pay otherwise...:"
