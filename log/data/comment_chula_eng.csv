Why do you know why? Believe that we have to see a doctor at Chula Hospital every month. Lah 1 time. Because the doctor examined 9.00-12.00 hrs. But whether we met the doctor sooner or later We always go back to the last house every year for nearly two years. Is a very bad feeling We went to see the doctor as soon as I wanted to get back soon Which sometimes the pharmacist every Saturday of every month in duty to use us to walk the drug itself Let us go up and take the medicine on the 11th floor. Sometimes I say that the drug cannot be withdrawn. The doctor wrote a prescription that was not regulated by the Ministry of Public Health. There was a time when we were endured because the pharmacist at the 3rd floor of the medicine room told us to go to see another doctor and give the new doctor that we went to look for drugs like our own doctor. Can&#39;t speak at all Out of words to say because I do not know what to use, I think it is very confusing, but that gives a score of 3, because the doctor who is treated with care is very good."
